## Topic 3: Metaheuristics for Optimization/DecisionProblems

An optimization problem is characterized by the existence of a (typically large) set of possible solutions, comparable to each other, of which one or more are considered (globally) optimal solutions.<br>
Depending on the specific problem, an evaluation function allows you to establish this comparison between solutions.<br>
In many of these problems, it is virtually impossible to find the optimal solution, or to ensure that the solution found is optimal and, as such, the goal is to try to find a local optimal solution that maximizes/minimizes a given evaluation function to the extent possible.<br><br>

In this work, the aim is to implement a system to solve an optimization problem, using different algorithms or meta-heuristics  such as:
- hill-climbing
- simulated annealing
- tabu search
- genetic algorithms
- (you may include other algorithms or variations of these)<br>

Multiple instances of the chosen problem must be solved, and the results obtained by each algorithm must be compared. Different parameterizations of the algorithms should be tested and compared,in terms of the average quality of the solution obtained and the average time spent to obtain the solutions.<br><br>

The application to be developed should have an appropriate visualization in text or graphic mode, to show the evolution of the quality of the solution obtained along the way and the final solutions,and to interactwith the user. You should allow the selection and parameterization of the algorithms and the selection ofthe instance of the problem to be solved<br><br>

## Programming Language: Python (Backup: Java) <br><br>

## Checkpoint: Moodle
Brief PDF presentation (max. 5 slides) with:
1. Specification of the work to be performed (definition of the game or optimization problem to be solved)<br>
2. Related work with references to works found in a bibliographic search (articles, web pages and/or source code)<br>
3. Formulation of the problem as an optimization problem (solution representation,neighborhood/mutation  and  crossover functions, rigid  constraints, evaluation functions)<br>
4. Implementation  work  already  carried  out  (programming language,  development environment, data structures, file structure, among others).<br><br>

## Final Delivery: Moodle
- PDF presentation (max. 10 slides) with:
- Implemented code, properly commented, including a “readme” file with instructions on how to compile, run and use the program.<br>
Based on the submitted presentation, the students must carry out a demonstration (about 10 minutes) of the work, in the practical class, or in another period to be designated by the teachers of the course.<br><br>

The file with the final presentation should include, in addition to the aforementioned for the checkpoint, details on:<br>
5. The approach (heuristics, evaluation functions, operators, ...)<br>
6. Algorithms implemented (search  algorithms,minimax,metaheuristics)<br>
7. Experimental  results,  using  appropriate tables/plots and comparing the  various  methods,  heuristics,  algorithms  and respective  parameterizations for  different  scenarios/problems.<br><br>
The presentation  shall  include  a  slide  of  conclusions  and  another  of references consulted and materials used (software, websites, scientific articles, ...).
